# Hydra: AI-driven Geospatial Water Management System

Hydra AI is an innovative solution for monitoring and managing water resources using artificial intelligence and geospatial technology. This system combines NLP algorithms with geolocation data to provide real-time insights into issues into water-related challenges like scarcity, quality and flooding. Hydra AI facilitates efficient water distribution, optimizing resource allocation and ensuring sustainable usage. The locations of these issues are shared with authorities which can aid in relief. We have also created a basic dataset of water tanker locatations which can be used to dispatch resources to the nearest community in need.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Hydra AI utilizes NLP algorithms to analyze data from various sources, specifically twitter for now, to identify areas experiencing water scarcity.
- **Geospatial Mapping:** The system maps identified areas of water scarcity onto a geographic information system (GIS) for visualization and analysis.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Hydra AI continuously monitors water resources and updates authorities in real-time about areas in need of immediate attention.
- **Optimized Resource Allocation:** By leveraging AI-driven insights, Hydra helps authorities or private water tankers to optimize the allocation of water resources, ensuring equitable distribution to affected areas.
